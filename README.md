# Manjaro-i3-Dracula-Theme
A tool to automatically apply the dracula theme on the Manjaro i3 Linux distrobution. I recommend using this tool in concert with the Dracula Theme Applier app which I built. The theme applier provides GTK integration, whereas this tool just themes the Manjaro i3 environment.

All you have to do to run this tool is cd into the cloned repo and run ./install.sh. The script simply backs up your existing .Xresources and i3 config files and replaces them with my defaults.

Dracula is not my work. I just made a script to integrate dracula into my thinclient device.
